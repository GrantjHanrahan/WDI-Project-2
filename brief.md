## PROJECT[2] DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past 8 weeks together! For
project[2] you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web
development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends,
family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. The type of
web application you create is your choice.

The objective of this project is to:

* To pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

You will be working **in groups of your own choosing** for this project. This means that the core criteria include:


* _effective use of git & GitHub_ to allow several developers to work simultaneously on the same codebase, manage merge conflicts, etc.
* _good teamwork skills_, i.e. task delegation, pair programming, communication with team members, compromise etc.

**NOTE: In the planning phase of this project your group will have to reach some kind of consensus about the details of the project. This means that even if you personally want to implement a particular feature or use a specific framework, you will not be able to do so for this project if the rest of your group doesn't agree on it.
Set it aside for your final project instead!**

Show us what you've got!

**IDEA:**
PHASER.JS >>> RPG >>> TURNBASE >>> GA SYDNEY >>> BATTLE >>> FIRST MULTIPLE FLOORS

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are
associated correctly!

MODEL 1: USER
MODEL 2: GAME >> CHARACTERS >> DIALOG
MODEL 3: SAVE

* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) up your views.

ADD NOTHING IN Views

* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify valid (and unique) email addresses, and secure passwords.

YES!

* **Use Gems.** Use a GEM to add extra functionality to your app.



* **Use AJAX.** Make AJAX requests to handle any interactions with your own server that should happen transparently, i.e. without a page reload (such as liking/favouriting a post, adding tags, autocomplete-based search, etc).



* **User Login.** Make sure you have basic authentication and authorization set up. Ensure that users cannot edit the items created by other users, and that general users cannot access admin-only features!
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku.

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
We may not have covered all of these in class, but if you want to push yourself
and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with
your app.

* **CSS Framework.** Use either Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton or Materialize to kickstart your front-end.

BOOSTRAP CSS FRAMEWORK

* **File upload.** Take a look at Cloudinary, Carrierwave and AWS/S3.

AVATAR

* **Web Scraping.** Check out Nokogiri.



* **Maps/Geolocation.** Google Maps integration, ideally via the Geocoder gem; also Maps extension JS libraries such as Leaflet for drawing paths, etc.



* **Visualistions.** Visualise your data with interactive graphs using a JS library such as D3.
* **New browser APIs.** Experiment with exciting new browser APIs such as the WebAudio API, HTML5 Webcam API, accelerometer/gyroscope API, WebBluetooth API, Websockets API, Canvas 2D drawing, etc.


* **Frontend Framework.** Try out React.js or Vue.js to create a Single-Page App interface to your site for a smoother user experience.

PHASERS.JS

 **WARNING:** If you decide to try out a frontend framework which you've only just started learning, _be ready to end up with substantially fewer working features_ in your project than if you stick to the now-familiar Rails CRUD template system. Ideally, you should get a full Rails CRUD system working early in the project, and then _only if you have time_ should you try out a SPA interface.

* **Browser Extension.** Create your own Chrome browser extension to easily save data from other sites to your own while browsing.


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

#### Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do
you reasonably think you can implement in the time period? Remember: "Must Could Should Would" and the "pyramid of features".

## **MUST**
RAILS SERVERS
USER LOGIN
GAME INITIALISE
BASIC CHARTERS MOVEMENT

## SHOULD WE DO
BRANCH OUT
MULTIPLE CHARACTERS
BATTLES
ITEMS
STORY LINE


* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.



* **Wireframes.** Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work. Paper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Gliffy or Omnigraffle.



* **Group Task Managament.** Use a site like Trello to assign & track tasks across your group.

TRELLO

* **Milestones.** Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.



* **Readme.md** Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project: a how and why of what you wanted to solve, how you built, problems, tech used.

####  Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* In the correct places. Logic in views? Fat controllers?
* Is it DRY? Can I reuse parts of this project's code? Should I break this code down into more functions?
* Well-commented. Will we understand what is going on? Will _you_ understand it in two weeks?
* Well-formatted. Make it pretty.
* Adheres to a styleguide.

We’ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself.
* How well you were able to colloborate and compromise with the other members of your group.
